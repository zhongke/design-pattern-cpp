Design pattern description by C++

Here is another version implementation based on Book "Head First Design pattern" which was decribed by C++.
Any comments are welcome.

# Design Principle
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Design Pattern

### Strategy Pattern 
  - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
  
### Observer Pattern 
  - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
    all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator Pattern 
  - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
    Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
